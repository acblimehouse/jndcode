## Poster - <i> Jobs and Drugs: Time Series Analyses of labor market and income indicators and proxies for opioid abuse at the country level.</i>
## Abstract
A significant theme of the 2016 US Presidential Election campaign was the opioid
epidemic and itâ€™s effect on communities across the country. According to the NIH,
between 2002 and 2015, overdose deaths from all opioids increased by 280%. Several
competing narratives have been put forward to explain the explosion in opioid-related
morbidity and mortality: the introduction of pain as the fifth vital sign in the late
1990s, the hallowing out of the industrial heartland of America, and the acceleration
of growth in income inequality since the mid-1970s. Government data across a broad
range of policy topics including labor statistics, hospital admissions, corrections, and
the census provides an invaluable tool to examine these narratives and generate
testable hypotheses. <br><br>
<b> This poster will showcase how the choice of data and measures
can lend credence or refutation to the narratives above. The goal is to demonstrate
that in order to understand and address a policy problem like the opioid epidemic we
need a variety of data sources that each offer different perspectives on the issue. </b>
